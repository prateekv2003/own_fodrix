              <p className="aboutus_para">
                The Founder and CEO, Ankit Kesarwani loves to travel and capture
                travel memories. He has travelled extensively around India. So,
                based on his travelling experiences, his friends would always
                enquire whether he knew any local photographers of the cities they
                were planning to visit. This is when Ankit realised that what if
                there is a simple way to connect travellers and photographers. With
                this idea in his mind and willingness, he founded Fodrix as an
                online platform, intending to connect people with the professional
                photographers in India.
